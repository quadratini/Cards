# Blackjack
A classic game of Blackjack where the user can play against the computer (aka the house).
The standard rules of Blackjack apply.

## Implemented Rules
1. The Dealer must hit until he has 17 or more.
2. Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
3. Getting 21 on your first 2 dealt cards is "Blackjack," and you win.
4. You win when you beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
5. If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
   
## NOT implemented:
1. Splitting also doubles the bet, because each new hand is worth the original bet. 

# First Iteration
The first part of the project was just a card drawing simulator where the user can draw
a card from the top of the deck, and the window shows the card. The shuffle button shuffles the deck
with the remaining cards left. The reset button shuffles the deck and returns all cards to the deck.

# Second Iteration
The full game of Blackjack, has features such as the player getting BlackJack, the Ace being a 1 or
an 11, depending on what is favorable for the player, etc.

I got 3 Blackjacks in a row, which is a 1 in 10000 chance of happening. Lol

1st pair: Ace of Spades & Jack of Diamonds

2nd pair: Ace of Spades & King of Spades

3rd pair: Queen of Hearts & Ace of Clubs
